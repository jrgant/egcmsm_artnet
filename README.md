# ART-Net Analysis

This project contains the empirical analysis of ART-Net data to inform input and other parameters for the extragenital gonorrhea model.

## Privacy Restrictions

ART-Net data is private and not to be shared. This project should only ever refer to the external Private-Data directory on the C:\ drive. That is, the data itself should never be imported or saved within this project directory unless in aggregated form.
