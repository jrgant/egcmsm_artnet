# ART-Net Analysis

This project contains the empirical analysis of ART-Net data to inform input and other parameters for the extragenital gonorrhea model.

## Privacy Restrictions

ART-Net data is private and not to be shared. This project should only ever refer to an external private data directory containing the ARTNet data, available on request via a Memorandum of Understanding (PI: Samuel Jenness, Emory University). The ARTNet data itself should never be imported or saved within this project directory unless in aggregated form.
